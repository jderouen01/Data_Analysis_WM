Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of the Influence of Color on Working Memory


This is data cleaning, analysis, and visualizaiton of an undergraduate research project conducted in 2020 regarding the influence of color on working memory. This project was conducted at Columbus State University and distributed using their internal SONA platform. The survey was developed using Qualtrics. Participants were assigned one of three levels of the independant variable color, either black, blue, or red. They were then measured on the amount of words from a set word bank they could remember depending on the color of the word they were randomly assigned. This was a 3x1 between-subjects design. For the main analysis a one-way ANOVA was used. Exploratory analysis was later done using other statistical models such as OLS and two-way ANOVA.
